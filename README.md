# Handcrafted MLP-BP and SGD-Momentum/Adam(Based-on MNIST)
In order to make a record of my homework which was handed out on the Computer Vision Class, I published my codes here.

## What I do in this repository
In this repository, I just use **numpy library** to **accomplish a MLP and the BP algorithm**. I **won't use any deep learning architecture such as pytorch.**

In order to make it more perfect, I **also accomplish a SGD+Momentum optimizer and an Adam optimizer.**

I also use **struct library** to **parse the MNIST Dataset.** It is really interesting.

If you are insterested in it, you can watch the code for the details.

## Requirement Library
>- numpy
>- matplotlib
